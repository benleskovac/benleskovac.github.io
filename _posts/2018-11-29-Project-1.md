  The website I’m reviewing is Youtube. Youtube is a website that anyone can upload content to and other people who use Youtube can watch the video. Since its release, in 2005, it’s racked up multiple billion views and about 3 billion hours of video watched every month. That’s 342465.75 years, which is mind-blowing. Obviously, if it’s this popular and only available online, it has to have a good website, and that’s what I’m reviewing today. In this project I'll be displaying different screenshots and slides of Youtube, and I'll explain their functions in the slides.
