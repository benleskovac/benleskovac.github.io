By Ben Leskovac

The third project I did for my web design class is to choose a website and then edit it using inspect element and other things. Another component is this is looking at the basic code of a website and trying to change the css by using new code.

These are all of the images I used to edit my site. The site I used is called [coolmath](https://coolmathgames.com/)

This is the original description that I wrote for the project:

First, what I did to the site (coolmath.com) was I changed the background color from a dark blue to a dark pink. Then I messed around with the pixels, separating the body of the website from the header of the website by about 100 pixels. Finally, I changed the text for most of the games on the front page of the website to silly names like "This Game is Trash Ben is Amazing" and other things like that. I also changed the descriptions of the games. The links to to the games and other things stayed the same, I just changed the text.
