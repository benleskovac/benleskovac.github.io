By Ben Leskovac

  The theme I chose for my website is called poole/lanyon, originally by jekyll user mdo. The main reason I chose this theme is because it is quite nice and simple, the text compliments the background, and the background compliments the images I'm using for the posts.

The changes I make would probably font size, because the font seems a little too large, the order of posts, so the newest posts I have are at the front of my website, and maybe the background color. Besides that, I like the layout of the website a lot, and besides minor edits, I don't need to mess around with too many options before it is satisfactory.
