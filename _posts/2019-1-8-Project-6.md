By Ben Leskovac

  The theme I chose for my website is called poole/lanyon, originally by jekyll user mdo. The main reason I chose this theme is because it is quite nice and simple, the text compliments the background, and the background compliments the images I'm using for the posts.

The changes I make would probably font size, because the font seems a little too large, the order of posts, so the newest posts I have are at the front of my website, and maybe the background color. Besides that, I like the layout of the website a lot, and besides minor edits, I don't need to mess around with too many options before it is satisfactory. 

A new page I could add could be how I designed and changed the website, possibly with a step by step tutorial about how I forked the website from mdo, and changed the necessary functions to personalize the website and create my own public link to it, as well as making this website available to changes. I think this would broaden knowledge to other students like me, and my own project could double as a teaching method to other students taking classes like website design and learning how to do similar tasks to what I am doing and have already done.
