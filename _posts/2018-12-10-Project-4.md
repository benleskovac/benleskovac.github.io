By Ben Leskovac

This project focuses mainly around creating the website that you're reading this on, what changes I made, what code I wrote, and what I used to do it all.

This is the what the main page of the code looks like:

This website came with a template which already had all of these folders. I edited most of these folders so instead of looking like a template it looked like my website.

I added pictures into my website under the posts section to depict the things I created. I changed the css and changed the color of the page, the text, the font, the size and more. The link to my website is this:
[https://maynard-schools.github.io/jekyll-setup-benleskovac/.](https://maynard-schools.github.io/jekyll-setup-benleskovac/.)

Overall, I think the website looks pretty good, and I like everything I have done to it. It made me feel more advanced in web design.
