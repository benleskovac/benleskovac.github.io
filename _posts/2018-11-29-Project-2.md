Project 2: Website Stack. By Ben Leskovac

The website stack I am choosing is called the LAMP stack. LAMP stands for the four different code layers it’s made up of, which is Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. A stack is basically a group of codes stacked onto each other to perform a task. LAMP is an open-source place for web development, and it’s one of the most used stacks globally. The operating system is Linux, the web server is Apache, the RDBMS is MySQL, and the language for scripting is PHP.

The domain name for my stack is LAMP. To update a stack, you have to update a file for the application then deploy it with AWS CloudFormation. Next, you have to change the instance type of the underlying instance. Finally, you have to update AMI on your stack and you’re finished. The code repository lets you experiment freely and gives you control to basically do whatever you want with your site. The server architecture of LAMP is Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. The open source software is run by Wordpress.

The advantages of LAMP is that it’s completely open-source, so you can use it without any repercussions, and that it’s fully modifiable, so you can use it whenever you want however you want. It also gives you more customization with your website and allows you to do different things with it that other stacks wouldn’t allow. You aren’t following a template, you have complete control. Also, its host is Wordpress. The disadvantages of LAMP is that it’s made up of a stack of four codes, which requires you to have a good amount of knowledge to be able to proficiently use it. It takes a long time to learn and for beginners and is to complex to use for a simple website, so a small website should probably look at something simpler.

Three websites that use LAMP stack are Amazon, Facebook, and Google, along with most other websites everybody uses daily.
